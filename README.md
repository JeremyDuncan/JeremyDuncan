### Hi there 👋
I'm Jeremy Duncan,

  <p>I'm a highly motivated veteran that has over a decade of experience as an Electronic Technician and Network Administrator. I love solving problems and I work well with teams to accomplish projects.</p> 
  <p>I've been in the process of transitioning from my military career to a new career as a Software Engineer. During this transition I have been going to DeVry University full-time working towards a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems with a focus in Software Programming. I am interested in gaining real-world experience throught internships and mentorship.</p>
  <p>While going to DeVry I have also been aggressively self-learning other software languages and technologies such as: </p>
  <ul>
⭐️ JavaScript ⭐️ Node.js ⭐️ React ⭐️ HTML ⭐️ CSS ⭐️ C# ⭐️ Java ⭐️ Swift ⭐️ Python
  </ul>
