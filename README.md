### Hi there 👋
I'm Jeremy Duncan,

  <p>I'm a highly motivated veteran that has over a decade of experience as an Electronic Technician and Network Administrator. I love solving problems and I work well with teams to accomplish projects.</p> 
  <p>I've been in the process of transitioning from my military career to a new career as a Software Engineer. During this transition I have been going to DeVry University full-time working towards a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems with a focus in Software Programming.</p>
  <p>While going to DeVry I have also been aggressively self-learning other software languages and technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, React, C#, Java, and Swift.</p>
  <p>I am interested in gaining real-world experience throught internships and mentorship.</p>
