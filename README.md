### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jeremy Duncan,

  I'm a veteran that has over a decade of experience as an Electronic Technician and Network Administrator. I've been in the process of transitioning from my military career to a new career as a software engineer. During this transition I have been going to Devry University full-time working towards a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Information Systems with a focus in Software Programming.
